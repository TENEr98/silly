              Singer Dan Reynolds and drummer Andrew Tolman of Imagine Dragons
              met way back in 2008 when they were still students at Brigham
              Young University. Having the same passion in music, the duo
              recruited more members to complete lineup for their dream band.
              That's when Tolman's Daniel Wayne "Wing" Sermon and Sermon's
              college friend Ben McKee came in.
            </p>
            <p>
              They started out in Provo, Utah before moving to Las Vegas, where
              they eventually dropped their first three mini albums. The first
              EP, a self-titled one, arrived in 2010, followed by the second one
              "Hell and Silence" in the same year. They didn't waste time and
              dropped another EP "It's Time" a year later before they finally
              scored a recording deal for their full-length release.
            </p>
            <p>
              The band got their big break when they were called to step in for
              Train at the jam-packed Bite of Las Vegas Festival because Pat
              Monahan fell sick so his band couldn't perform at the event. Their
              popularity rose ever since due to positive word-of-mouth praise
              from the concergoers. "Our band wouldn't exist without Las Vegas,"
              Reynolds once said. "It's a great place for an artist to start
              out."

              Their debut album "Night Visions" was their collaboration with
              top-notch producer Alex da Kid. It was released in September 2012
              after at least four more EPs. The album peaked at No. 2 on Hot
              200, but the singles like "Radioactive" and "Demons" were the ones
              which really propelled them to mainstream stardom.
            </p>
            <p>
              "This record has been three years in the making," Reynolds said of
              their first album. "We feel that we have finally created something
              we are all truly proud of and that can hopefully inspire others
              and help them feel a little less alone. That's what music is
              about. It's the greatest communicator I know."

              "Radioactive" originally taken from EP "Continued Silence" reached
              top 3 on Hot 100 and continued to become one of the top 10
              multiple times. It broke the record for the longest run into the
              top five and became the best-selling rock song on the Nielsen
              SoundScan running list of best-selling rock songs in digital
              history.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Grammy win they got for the single put icing on the cake for
              their commercial success. They were nominated for Record of the
              Year and Best Rock Performance, and won the latter.

              The band's next big single was "Demons". Like its predecessor, it
              first appeared in "Continued Silence" before being included in
              "Night Visions". It peaked at No. 6 on Billboard chart and became
              an instant hit in various countries. They dedicated its music
              video to their fan who died of cancer in 2013.
            </p>
            <p>
              In support of their debut album, the band embarked on a 145-date
              tour. Senora Lanza served as the opening act for the tour, which
              saw the band performing across North America and Europe. Imagine
              Dragons wrapped up the tour in April 2014 at Lollapalooza in Sao
              Paulo, Brazil.

          <div class="content-text">
            <p>
              Shortly after wrapping up the tour, the band worked on their
              sophomore album "Smoke + Mirrors", which is greatly inspired by
              their tour. Prior to the album's release, Imagine Dragons released
              the lead single off their album "I Bet My Life". They also
              released a number of singles for other projects including "Battle
              Cry", which served as the soundtrack to "Transformers: Age of
              Extinction".
            </p>
            <p>
              "Smoke + Mirrors" was released on February 17, 2015. The band
              embarked on a world tour in support of the album. The tour began
              on April 12, 2015 and concluded on February 5, 2016. During the
              tour, Imagine Dragons released two new songs, "Roots" and "I Was
              Me". They also released a cover of Eagles of Death Metal's "I Love
              You All the Time" in support of the victims of Paris attacks.
            </p>

            <p>
              After the tour, frontman Reynolds told Billboard in an interview
              that the band would be taking a hiatus for the remainder of 2016.
              He stated, "This is the year we're going to actually take time
              off. We haven't stopped in, like, six years, so we've forced
              ourselves to take a year off."

          <div class="content-text">
            <p>
              Despite taking on a hiatus, Imagine Dragons released some
              soundtracks, including "Sucker for Pain", which served as the
              soundtrack to anti-hero flick "Suicide Squad". They also recorded
              "Levitate" for sci-fi movie "Passengers (2016)".
            </p>
            <p>
              Towards the end of 2016, Imagine Dragons began teasing their third
              studio album. In January 2017, the band started teasing the lead
              track off the album, "Believer", on social media. The single was
              released in the following month and was used as part of the Super
              Bowl LI advertisement for Nintendo Switch.
            </p>
            <p>
              The alternative rock band released second single "Thunder" in
              April before announcing the title of their third studio album
              "Evolve" as well as a tour in support of the album on May 8. They
              also released a new track "Whatever It Takes" on the same day as
              the announcement. "Evolve" was released on June 23.

              On February 21, 2018, Imagine Dragons released a new single
              entitled "Next to Me". The song was released as a part of a
              re-issue of "Evolve". In addition, the band announced the summer
              dates of their "Evolve" tour.
