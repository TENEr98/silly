          <section>
            <p class="text">
              Young musician Alan Khadzaragov, more known as MATRANG was born in
              the capital of Ossetia – Vladikavkaz in 1995. Father and the
              mother of Alan of the profession doctor and teacher respectively.
              In the school the boy went not as all his contemporaries into 7
              years, but it is earlier in the year. Already in the first class
              of instructress of the regional chorus “of Arion” examined in Alan
              vocal talent and it invited first-grader to be occupied and to
              sing in the polecat. To the third class the boy became the soloist
              of the children's chorus “of Arion”. In parallel with the
              appearances in the polecat Alan Khadzaragov from the first class
              actively dealt with drawing — this was his basic hobby, to which
              it gave the large part of the free time. In 4 classes the parents
              returned boy to the art school, in which Alan studied 4 years. In
              9 classes the fellow decided to leave the composition of the
              chorus, more than the time he began to carry out with the friends
              on the street, but drawing it did not throw. After the end of 11
              classes the fellow entered into local VUZ (INSTITUTE OF HIGHER
              EDUCATION) for specialty “design and design”, but so he did not
              finish teaching. In 2016 Alan left the home town and moved to live
              in Moscow.

            <p class="text">
              The first prerequisites for the creation in fellow appeared even
              in the secondary school, when Khadzagarov it began to write verses
              and novels. The inclination to the writing of its own music
              appeared in Alan in 11 classes. Specifically, then it began to
              write the first tracks. Creative pseudonym Alan Khadzagorov
              selected for MATRANG. At the time of studies in 11 classes and in
              the first two courses of Univera of MATRANG they released 27
              tracks and came out on 11 local concerts. Already then many young
              Ossetians pleased music, which Alan made. The basic
              acknowledgement of young musician MATRANG's creation arrived after
              his passage to Moscow.
